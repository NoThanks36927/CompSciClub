# Instructions

**This is for those of you who are iterested in the creative side of coding.**

*"mobius_flame.pde"* is a *Processing* source file. *Processing* is a free open-source IDE made for creative coding and can be downloaded from *Yritysportaali*. After downloading the program, you should be able to open the source file in *Processing*.

You can run the file by pressing *ctr + r* or by pressing the triangle shaped button at the top left of the screen.

**Controls**
- Move by dragging the mouse
- Zoom with the mouse wheel
- Press *t* to create a new transformation
- Press *s* to save the current image

**Playing with the code**

You are free to modify the code to your liking! You can for example see how changing the variables affects the images. Some options I recommend starting with are:
- *gamma*
- *color_blend_factor*
- *transformation_colors*

If you're feeling adventurous try modifying the algorythm itself. How does an additional sin function affect the images?

**What kind of images can you make?**
