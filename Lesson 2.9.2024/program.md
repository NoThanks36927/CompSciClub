Some more thoughts on the content of today's meeting:
- installing software: intellij, vs code, or some other editor, wsl.
- going over the forms answers
- discussing what topics we'll do
- more about the way the club is run. Mainly whether we want to have a traditional student-teacher relationship or more of a free form meeting place for nerds, where we might have some lectures, do exercises and projects, and share ideas. The latter is closer to what I advocate for. Of course your and the participants' opinions count.
- some basic concepts of programming with java: variables, expressions, iteration, functions.
- deciding how information will be shared. Some options include github, or onedrive.
